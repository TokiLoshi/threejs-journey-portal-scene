# Three.js Journey Portal Scene

## About this project

This fun portal scene is part of a series in Bruno Simon's [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). It combines 3D modeling with Blender, baking and UV unwrapping, optimization, and writing custom shaders, with the wonderful perlin noise function thanks to [Stefan Gustavson](https://gist.github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/670c22f3966e662d2f83).

Blender has been a huge learning curve but also a lot of fun. Not everything went quite according to plan, and I landed up with a floating rock, but look forward to adding to it and building on it in the future.

A huge thank you to Bruno Simon for this wonderful course. I'm certain I will keep coming back to the lessons on this journey.
